#INTRO
When thermal energy :fire is applied to an atom, classical **equipartion** dictates that the applied energy has to go into various **modes**.
For a lone atom (known as a **monoatomic** atom), there exist only __three__ translational modes corresponding to motion along the **x**, **y** and **z** axis. For a **diatomic** molecule however, we can have more complex behaviour.
